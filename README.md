# Better FIll
 
Very early concept of world edit for minecraft bedrock using the scripting api.

 ## Usage
* !select - running this command will give you an enchanted axe in your mainhand, it will prompt you o break a block and select the first corner of your selection region, it will then prompt you to break another block to select the other corner of your selection region. Both corners you select will be replaced with redstone blocks to indicate where you have selected. After you have selected you will lose the axe and your region is saved.
* !fill <block> - this will fill your selected region with the specified block (example: !fill diamond_ore)
* !replace <toreplace> <replacewith> - this will replace all instances of your first block in your region with the second block that you chose
